## Improvements Directions
1. Seperate Express routing from app.js 
2. Enable friendly alert when there is error modifying restaurant data (it now redirects user to homepage only)
3. Enable user to choose what target to search, is it name or category
4. Enable user to choose how the list is sorted, by what property, and in ascending or descending order
